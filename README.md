Project Outline:

Seagrass Distribution Modelling

Seagrasses are pivotal ecosystem engineers. This marine plant is responsible for maintaining an extremely biodiverse habitat that many different species depend upon. However, a scarce amount of research has been conducted on seagrass phylogeny and global distributions. In the face of rapid climate change, I want to conduct spatial distribution modeling of all seagrass taxa on a global scale to determine if climate change variables (i.e. sea level rise, increasing temperatures, etc.) have altered the distributions of seagrass communities. In order to study this effect, I need to be able to manipulate seagrass occurrence data and create codes that can adapt this data to produce spatial models. For my course project in this class, I would like to create a current distribution model of seagrasses worldwide so that I may attain the skills I need to conduct this same task in the future over different time periods (i.e. a past model depicting distributions prior to substantial climate change and a predicted future model.)

By the time the GitHub Repository “Read Me” is due on Week 5, I plan to have collected all of the occurrence data of the seagrass species I wish to include in this model into a .csv file from GBIF. Currently, I am reconciling the taxonomy to determine which species are legitimate. 

Shortly after this date, I will begin to conduct background research to determine which type of spatial distribution model I want to produce and how I will do this using code in R software. I am hoping that this will shed light on how I will need to edit my seagrass data in order to make it compatible with this task. I plant to determine how to edit my data in some manner by Week 6 so that I can submit that code as my first working function to GitHub.

After further research (as well as some outside help I am already assuming I will need from my advisor and/or Chris Bird,) I will be able to expand on my current code to further manipulate my data in any way necessary so that it will be ready to incorporate into R. This will be what I submit for my second working function with data on Week 7.

My next goal would be to produce my first draft of the seagrass spatial model using my codes in R. This will hopefully be included in the Latex or Markdown draft that I will submit during Week 10. If I cannot produce my first spatial model at this stage, then I will submit all other coding work that has been completed at that point with descriptions on these codes and what still needs to be completed for my seagrass model.

In the following weeks leading up to the due date of the final draft of this project, I produce my spatial model to represent current seagrass distributions from my previously collected data. Once this has been complete, I will be able to submit my final report explaining my code and the model that it creates as well as the relevance of this research topic. This will ultimately be completed by Week 13.
